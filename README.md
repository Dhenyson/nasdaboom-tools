**Heads up:**
This app was created at the beginning of my studies, without environment variables and several errors, but I made it public without correcting or improving the code because my intention is just to follow my evolution. I left the sensitive data as empty strings, but the rest is 100% functional.

**React-native (EXPO)**

The focus of the app was to study requests, so I purposely mixed different requests and connections, such as: Firebase, GoogleSheets, REST API and Web Scrapping.
